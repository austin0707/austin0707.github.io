    <h1 align="center">Project 4: [Auto]Stitching Photo Mosaics</h1>
    <h2 align="center">Austin Zhu</h2>

    <div>
        This project features the implementation of algorithms to stitch together disparate images into 
        a larger mosaic of the images, using both user-defined correspondences and automatic methods.

        <h2 align="middle">Part A: Image Warping and Mosaicing</h2>
        For the first part of this project, we aim to warp and blend images using correspondence points
        we indicate to merge multiple images into a mosaic.

        <h3 align="left">Recovering Homographies</h3>
        Using two sets of correspondence points <code>im1_points</code> and <code>im2_points</code>
        which are two \(n\times 2\) matrices, we can estimate a homography
         between the correspondence points (a projective transformation). Remember
        that homographies have 8 degrees of freedom, therefore we need at least 4 pairs of correspondence points 
        to determine a homography.
        <br><br>
        For each pair of points \(x_1, x_2\) and \(x_2, y_2\), we can find two linear equation constraints
        they correspond to by the following argument:
        $$H = \begin{bmatrix} a & b & c \\
        d & e & f \\
        g & h & 1 \end{bmatrix}$$
        $$H\begin{bmatrix} x_1 \\ y_1 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} wx_2 \\ wy_2 \\ w \end{bmatrix}$$
        Plugging in our unknown values from the matrix \(H\) and plugging in the value \(w\), we get the following equations:
        $$ax_1 + by_1 + c - gx_1x_2 - hy_1x_2 = x_2$$
        $$dx_1 + ey_1 + f - gx_1y_2 - hy_1y_2 = y_2$$
        which gives the matrix equation:
        $$Ah = \begin{bmatrix} x_1 & x_2 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & -x_1x_2 & -y_1x_2 \\
        0 & 0 & 0 & x_1 & x_2 & 1 & -x_1y_2 & -y_1y_2 \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} a\\b\\c\\d\\e\\f\\g\\h \end{bmatrix} 
        = \begin{bmatrix} x_2 \\ y_2 \end{bmatrix} = b$$
        <br>
        Thus, for every pair of correspondence points, we get two more rows for the matrix \(A\) and column vector \(b\).
        If we have only 4 pairs of correspondence points, then \(A\) is invertible, thus \(h = A^{-1}b\).
        <br><br>
        If we have more than our system is overdetermined and we can use least-squares to find a solution
        that minimizes the mean squared error of the homography, which gives us:
        $$h = (A'A)^{-1}A'b$$

        <h3>Warp the Images</h3>
        Now given a homography, we can warp an image using the homography by using the concept of 
        an inverse warp similar to what we did in project 3. First, we map the corners of the original 
        image through the homography to find the bounds of the warped image. Then, we can use <code>polygon</code>
        to get all of the internal points of the warped images and warp them through the inverse of the 
        homography to get their coordinates in the original image. Each pixel values in the warped image is 
        set to its inverse warped pixel in the original image, with aliasing handled by using <code>griddata</code>.

        <h3>Rectifying Images</h3>
        Now that we have the means to calculate the homographies between images and can warp images 
        according to those homographies, we can use this to rectify images, aka take rectangular objects 
        that have been photographed at an angle, and warp the image so that the object is now rectangular.
        Correspondence points are manually labeled using the provided correspondence tool from project 3.
        Result for two images are below:

            </table>

        <h3>Blend the Images into a Mosaic</h3>
        Now, by labeling correspondences between two images that we want to create a mosaic of, we 
        can warp one image into the projective plane of the other image to align them. By doing some
        padding to the other image regarding the differences in dimension, we have solve the issue of 
        alignment.
        <br><br>
        In order to blend the images together, we use <code>morpohology.distance_transform_edt</code>
        on each image (with the original images barely brightened by 0.0001 to distinguish them from the 
        background), call the results <code>dist1</code> and <code>dist2</code>. 
        This gives a measure of how far each point is from the background. 
        Then, applying a logical operator of <code>dist1 > dist2</code>, we end up with a mask for 
        which areas of the combining image should be sampled from image 1 (1 - mask gives image 2).
        Finally, we blend the two images using this mask by a two-level Laplacian stack, taking the 
        code that I wrote in from project 2 to get our final blended mosaic.
        <br><br>
        To showcase this algorithm, I find correspondence points and blend the following 3 sets of 
        images into mosaics, with results (as well as intermediate mosaics) shown below:
        <br><br>

        the original color most preserved.

        Here we notice a few more visual artifacts in that one part of the pole isn't completely 
        aligned and a lady's body is unfortunately cut in half. However, these are issue more stemming 
        from problems when taking the photos rather than the algorithm itself.

        Again here we notice some artifacts in lighting and alignment due to different camera exposures 
        and human error in slight shifts of the center of projection. But overall, the algorithm performs 
        fairly well at mitigating these issues.

        <h2 align="middle">Part B: Feature Matching for Autostitching</h2>
        In this second part of the project, the goal is now to automatically determine correspondences 
        and compute homographies that way so we don't have to manually compute them.
        
        <h3 align="left">Step 0: Harris Interest Point Detection</h3>
        To first get a bank of interest points over which to check, we will use Harris corner detection 
        on a single scale. This is simply done using the provided sample code. 
        <br><br>
        Running this on one of the bay sunset photos, we find:

        </div>
        As we can see, the Harris points are fairly dense and don't already great at specifically 
        choosing potential correspondence points for us.

        <h3 align="left">Step 1: Adaptive Non-Maximal Suppression</h3>
        In order to reduce the number of interest points, while ensuring we still get points with 
        maximal harris values, distributed somewhat uniformly over the image, we use adaptive 
        non-maximal suppression as written in the paper.
        <br><br>
        The main idea behind the algorithm is to find the minimum suppression radius for each potential 
        interest point, defined by:
        $$r_i = \min_j |x_i - x_i|, s.t. f(x_i) < c_{robust}f(x_j), x_j \in \mathcal{J}$$
        This can be done pretty easily in code by using the provided <code>dist2</code> function and 
        checking if \(f(x_i) > c_{robust}\max f\), and if so, setting the value equal to \(\infty\).
        We then obtain our points by choosing the \(n\) points with the greatest minimum suppression radii.
        The idea of this algorithm is to choose points that don't have nearby points with much greater 
        Harris values then themselves, aka having a low minimum suppression radius.
        <br><br>
        Running this on our previous harris points with the suggested \(c_{robust} = 0.9\), we get: 
        <div align="middle"></div>
            <table style="width:100%">
                <tbody>

            </table>
        </div>
        As we can see, this algorithm was quite successful in reducing the number of points so that 
        the most important interest points are retained and that the points are fairly uniformly 
        spread out across the image.

        <h3 align="left">Steps 2-3: Finding Features and Matching Using Features</h3>
        As suggested in the paper, we construct a feature for each remaining interest point by sampling
        an \(8\times 8\) vector from a \(40\times 40\) surrounding pixel region around the point, from 
        a single image channel.
        <br><br>
        Then using these obtained features, we can perform a nearest neighbors matching algorithm with 
        distance as L2 norm. We then iterate through the points of image 1 and match each one with the 
        point in image 2 closest to it. To additionally remove false matches, we employ Lowe's trick and 
        reject any pair where the ratio between the 1-NN and the 2-NN distances is less than \(0.5\). This 
        parameter was chosen using Figure 6(b) from the paper to maximize correct matches while minimizing 
        incorrect matches.
        <br><br>
        The remaining points after running this matching algorithm on the 2nd and 3rd bay sunset photos are 
        shown below:
        <div align="middle"></div>
            <table style="width:100%">

                        <td>
                            <img src="media/sunset_matched1.png" align="middle" width="400vw">

                        </td>
                    </tr>
                </tbody>
            </table>
        </div>
        This matching scheme saw remarkable success in our two example photos here, with most of the 
        remaining points, having clearly correct matches.

        <h3 align="left">Step 4: 4-Point RANSAC</h3>
        Finally, in order to compute the correct homographies without having our results be ruining 
        by outliers, we employ 4-point RANSAC. The jist of RANSAC is that for each iteration,
        four pairs of points are randomly chosen and they have a homography computed on them. We then
        map all of the points of one set through the homography and compared their distances with the 
        actual paired points. If \(dist(Hp_1, p_2) < \epsilon\), then we consider it an inlier and with this, we
        compute a set of the inliers. 
        <br><br>
        RANSAC then repeats this iterations 1000 (or more) times and keeps a list of the largest set of inliers.
        Finally, the returned homography is the homography calculated from the set of inliers using the algorithm
        described in part A.

        <h3 align="left">Putting It All Together</h3>
        With all of these steps put in place, we end up with a homography that we can then pass into the 
        algorithm detailed in part A to warp and blend our images accordingly. The nice thing about this 
        algorithm is how we don't need to compute correspondences anymore, so we can put all of our desired 
        images into a list, and just let the algorithm run, appending each to the growing mosaic without 
        any input needed from us.
        <br><br>
        Below I show the results of this algorithm on the previous mosaics and as well as the manually 
        computed mosaic:

        Overall we can see that the automatic mosaics produce just as good mosaics as the manual version 
        and look very similar to each other. Note that for the street mosaic, I changed the order of blending 
        as with the original order, the artifact from an imperfect alignment resulted in an extremely large 
        number of Harris points that became very computational expensive to parse. I also changed the order 
        of the bay sunset mosaic to try and achieve less of a constrast due to the exposure differences.

        <h3 align="left">Coolest Part of this Project</h3>
        I think the coolest part for me was seeing how well our algorithms for the autostitching worked
        out. This was especially satisfying due to how annoying it was to calculate the correspondences 
        everytime I wanted to stitching together just 2 photos. (And the sunset photo took 4 stitchings!)
